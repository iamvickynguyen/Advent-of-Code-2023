# Advent-of-Code-2023
My first-ever Advent of Code venture ðŸš€

Turns out, I can use any tools or languages â€“ no need for perfect efficiency. It's a whole different vibe from my usual LeetCode and competitive programming routine.

## My take on solving Advent of Code (AOC):

### Debugging skills :bug:

Definitely improve. Sometimes, it took about 30 min to code, but entire day to debug.

### Toolbox :hammer_and_wrench:

No need to implement the entire algorithm/data structure from scratch. Just use libraries or whatever you have. This makes AOC different from Leetcode and other interview prep platforms. However, I usually write everything from the group up as a learning practice.

### Coding interviews training :computer:

Not a good strategy for coding interviews training. Firstly, it takes too long for 1 challenge, while you can spend the same amount of time on solving 5+ Leetcode problems. Secondly, you can have a quick and dirty solution, and it isn't helpful for interviews.

### Knowledge review :brain:

AOC helps me review various computer science concepts. Not sure if it's helpful for daily tasks, but it's good to do some brain exercise regularly.

### Efficiency :dart:

AOC has quite large inputs with many edge cases. I like it because it tries to simulate real-world scenarios and forces you to find efficient solutions.
